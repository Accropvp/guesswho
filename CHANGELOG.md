# 2.2

This is going to be a long one so here is a summary:

## Summary

This is the final update of guess who, meaning there will be no more updates after this one (except bugfixes and translations).
As a result the goal of this update is to deliver long overdue bugfixes and improvements.
The update contains the following highlights:

- Smarter and more performant NPCs

- New options for server owners
- Improved UI and icons

## NPCs

The NPCs have been completly rewritten.

- Better performance (you can now have more NPCs active at once if you like)
