## Guess Who?

Combine Spy Party, Hide & Seek and PropHunt and the result is this little gamemode.<br> 
In Guess Who two teams compete against each other, one trying to hide between NPCs and the<br> 
other one trying to hunt those cowards down.

The Hiding team can change their disguise. Depending on their boldness they can then decide to act<br>
similar to the NPCs and annoy the Hunters or they can just hide somewhere on the map. The Hunters<br>
will need to find out who is real and who is not which might seem a bit hard at the start, but if you<br>
carefully pay attention you will soon be able to spot all the differences between a NPC and a Player.

## Maps

The NPCs or NEXTBOTs will need a "navmesh" to function correctly. A "navmesh" is basically a map<br>
for NEXTBOTs which tells them where they can go and where not.<br>
Although the gamemode will auto generate a navmesh if a map doesn't have one. The AI could be<br>
bugged on some of those maps.

If you want to create a navmesh for another map you can follow this guide:<br>
[Navmesh Guide Here!](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485737805)

I will put the meshed maps and tested maps in the following collection so they are easier to find:<br>
